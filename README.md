## RPyG

<p>This project aims to be a RPG game.</p>
<p>You can choose your class among 3 and then a sub-class among 2.
Once your choice made, you will have to fights against mobs until level 50.
There are 10 zones in the game, you gain acces to the next one once you have reached the zone's maximum level and defeated its boss.
The levels of the different zones are 1-5,6-10,...,46-50.
The game is in french but you can translate it english if you want, it would be welcomed (or to any other language btw).</p>
