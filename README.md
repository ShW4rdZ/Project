This project aims to be a RPG game.
You can choose your class among 3 and then a sub-class among 2.
Once your choice made, you have to fights against mobs until the level 50.
There are 10 zones in the game, you gain acces to the next one once you have reached the maximum zone's level and defeated the zone's boss.
The levels of the different zones are 1-5,6-10,...,46-50.
The game is in french but you can do a translation in english if you want, it would be welcomed (or any other language btw).
